    <p><img src="fourthOfJuly.jpg" alt="family"> <br>Hello! My name is Lili, I am currently enrolled in the Masters
        of Software Development program at Boston University, and this is my website! It has been a great experience and
        quite the change from my previous career as a Recreational Therapist. I’m sure you’re curious – why make the big
        switch? Well, I enjoy debugging code more than debugging people’s minds; plus, software development provides so
        many more opportunities that I can’t wait to pursue. </p>
    <p>I hope to draw from my own personal experiences to provide inspiration for future projects. For example – I was a
        medic in the U.S. Army and am very interested in veteran outreach. I hope to use my programming knowledge to
        improve the lives of those who have served. Ultimately, I’d like to design software that connects veterans to
        their VA hospital treatment plans and goals. In addition to coding, I enjoy spending time outside with my
        husband and our four-legged friend, Oakley. </p>
